# Dynamic Graph Learning Repository

This repository contains the implementation of methods for learning dynamic graphs, which can be applied to analyze and visualize evolving structures in various complex systems.

## Repository Structure

The repository consists of three main files:

- **`helpers.py`**: This module contains helper functions that assist in the preprocessing and setup of the graph learning environment. 

- **`functions.py`**: This file includes all the essential functions necessary for the dynamic graph learning process. These functions are the core components that perform the main operations.

- **`project.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter notebook containing all the experiments and results.

## Getting Started

To run the project, ensure you have a Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed. You can start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxencehof/Dynamic_graph_learning_LTS4
cd your-repository-directory
```

To install dependencies, it's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the `project.ipynb`:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the `project.ipynb` file in the Jupyter interface to open it.
